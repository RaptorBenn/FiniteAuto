          The aim of this site is to provide resources relevent to the
          automotive recycling trade, from the start it will be divided into
          four pages, the Homepage, Resources (Gallery), The Model List, and
          the About/Contact page.
          <br><br>
          For those who don't work in the industry, yours isn't the same as
          every other model of the same year, alot of parts change mid year and
          others can be dependent on the country of origin and a variety of
          other factors. And I cannot stress enough the fact that they are
          hardly ever all the same.

          This website is a personal project of Benn Clarke, all files and

          <h4>Resources</h4>
          The resources section is planned to contain diagrams, and general
          information regarding vehicle specific changes to running models,
          part compatibility and fitting advice, and other relevant materials.
          <h4>Model List</h4>
          The model list is still in the design stage, the aim is to provide a
          tool for finding every permutation and variation of any make of
          vehicle.<br>
          This is quite a large problem as this information is simply not
          available and has to be either bought or gleaned from secondary
          sources.
